    <h2> Celebrating 30 Years </h2>
    <p>GREETINGS TO YOU ALL!! We have clocked in 30 years and the need to reflect on how far we have come, and how
        much more we can achieve into the future with God's help is of great <b>SIGNIFICANCE and need.</b>
        This major fundraising drive is to raise funds for the <b><i style="text-decoration: underline;">SCHOOL LIBRARY</i></b>. This facility
        is the heartbeat of our Academic lives. However, the library, in the last 30 years has not received the financial support
        that is should have recieved.
        Every important aspect of the library that should give its importance is in dire need of maintenance and upgrade. And so we believe that the alumni can come
        onboard and assist us in commemorating our 30<sup>th</sup> celebrations.

<section id="history">
    <h2>Port Moresby National High School</h2>
    <p> Port Moresby National High School (POMNATHS) was officially opened on the 1<sup>st</sup> of June, 1995 as a School of Excellence in Papua New Guinea (PNG). 
        Our school is located in the capital city of PNG, Port Moresby. POMNATHS is one of the six (6) National High SChools in the country and the only day school. In addition, it is a co-education institution. 
        Since its openening in the mid-90's POMNATHS has been one of the top schools in the country. The school has greatly contributed to the development of PNG
    by providing quality education and by supplying the country with much needed professional labour for the workforce.
        <br><br>
The school is nestled in a large campus and has a conference centre within its premises. Apart from the compulsory high school subjects, the school aslo tries to teach Christian values to the 
students through Religious Education classes conducted as part of the extracurricular activities every Wednesday afternoons.
The school also encourages physical enrichment by conducting sporting activities on Thursdays. Furthermore, POMNATHS being a melting pot of diverse cultures proudly hosts its annual cultural show known as the Hahenamo where
the students from the 22 provinces showcase their culture through traditional singing and dancing.
        <br><br>
The Government of Japan as a gift built Port Moresby National High School under the grant program of the people of Papua New Guinea. Apart from educating the youths of PNG
the school also serves as a symbol of solidarity between the two nations. The school is grateful for the continuous support
recieved from the people of Japan through their government. In 2011 when the Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami devastated the people of Japan, Port Moresby National High School students
with the help of their families contributed with cash and kind, which was donated to a school in Japan
that was affected by the disaster.
        <br><br>
The school is now 30 years old and the relationship between POMNATHS and the Japanese Government is strong and growing. In this year alone, two separate groups of POMNATHS
students were give the opportunity of travelling to Japan to attend a Science Fair and the Youth Ambassadors for World Tsunami Awareness Day
respectively. Port Moresby National High School still maintains a strong position as one of the top schools
in the country and is adamant on living up to its motto which is "TO DO GREAT THINGS WITH GOD'S HELP".</p>
